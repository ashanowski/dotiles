LanguageTool - language checker.
An Open Source language checker for English, French, German, Polish, Dutch, Romanian, Russian and other languages. This is a rule-based language checker that will find errors for which a rule is defined in its XML configuration files. Rules for more complicated errors can be written in Java. You can think of LanguageTool as a tool to detect errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect, e.g. mixing up there/their, no/now etc. It can also detect some grammar mistakes. It does not include spell checking.
LanguageTool will only find errors for which a rule is defined in its XML configuration files. Rules for more complicated errors can be written in Java.
Requires Java 6.0_04 or later. This version only works with OpenOffice.org 3.0.1 or later and you need to restart OpenOffice.org after installation of this extension.
You can select required grammar rules in Tools -> LanguageTool -> Configuration menu.
